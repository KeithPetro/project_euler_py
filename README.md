# project_euler_py
This project will consist of python solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) questions. Particular emphasis will be put on the efficiency and optimization of the solutions. If you are at all interested in working on Project Euler questions, or have a general interest in algorithms, I suggest trying some Project Euler questions out yourself prior to reading anyone else's solutions.

## Problem \#1 - Multiples of 3 and 5
### _Problem_:
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### _Solution(s)_:
There are multiple approaches to solve this problem. I have implemented 3 such solutions in `pe_1.py`.

Solution 1:

Solution 2:

This solution takes advantage of the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, S<sub>n</sub> = n(a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>n</sub>)/2.

Solution 3:

## Problem \#2 - Even Fibonacci Numbers
### _Problem_:
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### _Solution(s)_:
